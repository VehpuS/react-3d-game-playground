# Welcome to my 3D playground!
Starting from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGG0EeMNUl0&list=PLf8COyJwccaVMn0Jb6QxL9dcOM83fC7sv, let's see what I can build (probably moving on to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnXKmODEFHA&list=PLf8COyJwccaVMn0Jb6QxL9dcOM83fC7sv&index=2 as a first next step)

## TODOs (after the above)

* Play with imported assets
  * Tutorials
    * [https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/rendering-3d-objects-and-animation-in-react-using-three-fiber-bf0255e642be](rendering-3d-objects-and-animation-in-react-using-three-fiber).
  * Assets
    * [https://kenney.nl/assets?q=3d](Kenny's 3d Assets) - many CC0 options.
    * [https://3d.si.edu/object/3d/kylix:547c78d1-620b-40c4-982e-01928870fef4](Smithsonian)
    * Google Poly (closes soon!)
