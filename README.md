## About
Starting from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGG0EeMNUl0&list=PLf8COyJwccaVMn0Jb6QxL9dcOM83fC7sv), let's see what I can build (probably moving on to [creating a block game tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnXKmODEFHA&list=PLf8COyJwccaVMn0Jb6QxL9dcOM83fC7sv&index=2) as a first next step, but who knows).
